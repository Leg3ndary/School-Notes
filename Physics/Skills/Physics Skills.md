# Physics Skills for Grade 12
## Physics Lab Guidelines
*The teacher will inform you of what components to include for a particular experiment and how many marks the component is worth for a particular experiment. This will usually change from lab to lab*

## Description of Components of a typical Experiment Report
### Title Page
Includes the title, your name, any partners names, course, date, and teacher's name, though this is hardly ever needed.
### Purpose
State the objectives, purposes or aim of the experiment in a few sentences. Keep it short and sweet
### Introduction
This is an elaborate purpose. If including an introduction in the lab, do not include a purpose. The introduction will include the objectives, purpose or aim of the experiment. Why was the experiment performed? What is the specific purpose of the experiment? Show you know what is going on in the experiment and what it is about. What knowledge already exists about this subject? Has anyone completed this research previously, what did they find? Include any background research, theory and or equations pertinent and related to the experiment. Include APA and embedded citations. No citations in the introductory and final paragraphs, just your own words! The body paragraphs will have APA referenced citations.
### Question(s)
State the question(s) you are trying to find an answer(s) to, in the experiment. Include the variables you will be investigating in the question(s).
### Hypothesis
Write down an educated guess based on research and physics theory that answers your initial question. Make a prediction about the relationship (cause and effect relationship between the varaibles you are investigating.)
