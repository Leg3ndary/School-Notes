 # Also a simple lesson, just remember the few important things
## Definitions
- The **absolute maximum or global maximum** of a function is the highest point or maximum in the entire graph
	- This means that odd functions do not have absolute maximums
- The **absolute minimum** of a function is the lowest point or minimum in the entire graph
	- This means that odd functions again do not have absolute maximums
- Curves may also have **local minimums** or **local maximums** this is also self explanitory
- There is also **upwards and downwards concavity** which is the same as parabolas from quadratics
- **It should be noted graphs can have more than one absolute max and mins**

## Other Notes
- When graphing polynomials, use the curves but to approximate points, take half of the 2 points you're trying to find the curve of, and use the middle and solve to get the right y point
- When using interval notation, you can't assume lines are increasing at points you must use ) and ( to show that.
- Often times end behaviour will be described in an odd way
```py
x -> += infinity as f(x) -> -infinity
```
This means that for any value of x, x will be less than 0
- There wasn't really anything else, just review looking at how to find what graphs look like.
