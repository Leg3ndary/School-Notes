## Definitions
- **Order** refers to how many times the `x-intercept is repeated`
	- This can be found by the highest degree of the expression present
- **Point of Inflection** is a sort of repeating point, sort of like point symmetry, it will almost resemble a `sinusoidal wave`

## Factored Polynomials can give you the following info
- Sign of Leading Coefficient
- Degree of Polynomial
- End Behaviour
- Roots
- What occurs at each root
	- This will also have an order (Degree of term)
