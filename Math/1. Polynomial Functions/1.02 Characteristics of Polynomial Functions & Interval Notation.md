# Do Sign Practice
## Definitions
- **Order** refers to how many times the `x-intercept is repeated`
	- This can be found by the highest degree of the expression present
- **Point of Inflection** is a sort of repeating point, sort of like point symmetry, it will almost resemble a `sinusoidal wave`
- **Turning Point/Bouncing Point** this sort of point occurs at even degrees, it will almost bounce off the axis, not pass through it, you should know what this means

## Factored Polynomials can give you the following info
- Sign of Leading Coefficient *(Positive or Negative)*
- Degree of Polynomial
- End Behaviour ([[1.01 End Behaviour of Polynomial Functions and Even and Odd Symmtery#Info About Polynomial Functions|Remember Quadrants]])
- Roots
- What occurs at each root
	- This will also have an order (Degree of term)
	- This will tell us what type of line/curve will be at this point
	- When drawing, this doesn't have to be accurate, not in advanced functions anyways

## Determining Equations given Zeros, orders, and a point
Solving these types of equations is fairly simple, nothing complex
1. Write out all of the zeros given
	1. Make sure to factor these to only get whole numbers
2. Add in the appropriate `orders`
3. Input point and solve for a ([[1.01 End Behaviour of Polynomial Functions and Even and Odd Symmtery#Terms|Leading coefficientj]]) 

## Interval Notation
Lebid was a great teacher wasn't she, you should already know this, review if needed, has similar notation to most programming languages

### 2 Different types of Notation for intervals
```md
1. Inequality notation
-3 < x < 6
2. Interval/Bracket notation
x E (-3,6)
x E [-4, 5]
These 2 are the same, brackets represent exclusive, square brackets represent inclusive
```
You should note when using infinity, you always use a regular bracket, this means `without bound`

### Intervals of Increase and Decrease
A function `f(x)` is **increasing** on an interval `x E (a, b)` if `f(x2) > f(x1)` whenever `x2 > x1`

A function is **decreasing** on an interval `x E (a, b)` if `f(x2) < f(x1)` whenever `x2 < x1`
