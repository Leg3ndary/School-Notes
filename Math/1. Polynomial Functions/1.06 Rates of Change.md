# Long lesson, not on test
## Terms
- A **rate of change** is a measure of the change in one quantity (the dependant variable) with respect to a change in another quantity (the independant variable)
- There are 2 types of **rates of change**
	- Average rate of change `AROC`
	- Instantaneous rate of change `IROC`
- An **average rate of change** is a change that takes place over an interval, while an **instantaneous rate of change** is a change that takes place in an instant
- A **secant** line is a line that passes through two different points on a graph which also gives **average rate of change**
- A **tangent** line is a line that will match the **instant rate of change** it's also called the point of tangency
- You can use the curly lines `~` to show similarity but not equality
- **Make sure you keep every single decimal when answering questions**

## Average Rate of Change
You'll usually use the following formula:
```md
y2 - y1
-------
x2 - x1
```
which will subsequently give you the average rate of change

## Instantaneous Rate of Change
An instantaneous rate of change that takes place in an instant, to calculate this, we should use calculus, but we use a pretty odd method that is pretty inaccurate.
```md
f(a + h) - f(a)
---------------
   a + h - a

Which becomes

f(a + 0.001) - f(a)
-------------------
	   0.001
```
Basically, this is based off the principal that when you get closer and closer to a point with a secant line, the closer it will be to the tangent line.

This means we just use `0.001` as the difference in `x` or in the above formula we use `h`.
