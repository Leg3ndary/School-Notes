# Long lesson, not on test
## Terms
- A **rate of change** is a measure of the change in one quantity (the dependant variable) with respect to a change in another quantity (the independant variable)
- There are 2 types of **rates of change**
	- Average rate of change `AROC`
	- Instantaneous rate of change `IROC`
- An **average rate of change** is a change that takes place over an interval, while an **instantaneous rate of change** is a change that takes place in an instant
- A **secant** line is a line that passes through two different points on a graph which also gives **average rate of change**
- A **tangent** line is a line that only touches a single point, this will match the **instant rate of change**

## Average Rate of Change
You'll usually use the following formula:
```md
y2 - y1
-------
x2 - x1
```
which will subsequently give you the average rate of change

## Instantaneous Rate of Change
An instantaneous rate of change that takes place in an instant
