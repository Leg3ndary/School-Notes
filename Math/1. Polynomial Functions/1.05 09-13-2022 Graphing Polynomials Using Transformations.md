## Today was boring
We just did review of changing and applying transformations to graphs

- Remember that the order of transformations matter
	- Reflections
	- Stretches
	- Translations
- Remember to also use mapping notation where you state the base and all the transformations that are applied
- To check if a graph has been stretched or compressed compare values from x to y from the original and latter graph, not hard
