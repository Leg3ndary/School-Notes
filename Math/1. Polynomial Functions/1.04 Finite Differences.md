# Another simple lesson, just gotta remember the finite difference formula
## Terms
- A **finite difference table** for function `f(x)` is just the same as anything, you take the bottom and subtract it from the top
- A **factorial** `(n!)` is defined by `n! = n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n-3)...(2)(1)`
- The **finite difference formula** is `FD = a(n!)`, n is the degree of the function

## Finite Differences
- The `x` differences will match up with the degree of a function
	- For example, the `third` differences will match up with a `cubic` function
- The sign of the leading co-efficient will also be the same as the sign of the constant value of the finite differences
- You should review finding the equations from graphs, and graphs from equations
- Everything else was easy
