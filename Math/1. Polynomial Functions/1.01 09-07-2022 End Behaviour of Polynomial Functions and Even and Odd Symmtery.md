# Was a simple lesson, mainly remember the few things below
## Terms
- **Polynomial Function** of degree `n` whose equation can be written as something like a quadratic, you know this.
- **Leading Coefficient** is the coefficient of the largest variable in terms of degree
- **Constant** is the same as programming
- **Even and Odd Degree Functions** are functions who are named base off the highest power of the function
- **End Behaviour** refers to the direction in which the function travels, its expressed by stating the starting and ending quadrants *(Eg. Q3 => Q4)*
- **Power Function** is a polynomial of the form `f(x) = ax^n` where `n` is a whole number, `x` is a variable and `a` is a real number.
	- Note that these functions will have a flatter curve as the power gets bigger; this is because of how decimals work through bigger powers
- **Even Symmetery** is when the function is symmetric over the `y-axis`
	- Not all even polynomial functions have even symmetry
	- There is only 1 rule to determine the type of symmetry for an even polynomial function
		- Can only have even degree terms
		- In this case, the constant only pushes the function up or down along the `y-axis`, this doesn't affect `y-axis` symmetry
	- This function has what's called `line` symmetry when it is symmetrical across a line, when that line is not the `y-axis`
	- Note this can never have `origin` symmetry
- **Odd Symmetry** is when the function is symmetric around the `origin` (180 Degrees)
	- Not all odd polynomial functions have odd symmetry
	- There are 2 rules to determine the type of symmetry for an odd polynomial function
		- All other terms have odd powers (No Even, 2, 4, 6, 0)
		- In the special case of a constant (power 0) the function will have what's known as point symmetry, where it is symmetrical around a `point`, but not the `origin`
	- Note this can never have `y-axis` symmetry


## Types of Polynomial Functions
- Constant
- Linear
- Quadratic
- Cubic
- Quartic
- Quintic

## Info About Polynomial Functions
- Odd degree functions are always real, in both domain and range
- Even Degree Functions will always have a X E R
	- However Y will be above or below a certain point, such that it fulfills the requirements
- Odd degree polynomials with positive leading coefficients go from **Q3 => Q1**
- Odd degree polynomials with negative leading coefficients go from **Q2 => Q4**
- Even degree polynomials with positive leading coefficients go from **Q2 => Q1**
- Even degree polynomials with negative leading coefficients go from **Q3 => Q4**

## Algebraically verifying Even and Odd Symmetry
- Functions with **even symmetry** will satisfy the equation `f(x) = f(-x)`
- Functions with **odd symmetry** will satisfy the equation `f(-x) = -f(x)`
- When checking if a polynomial has symmetry when in expanded or other form, just factor out `-1` from every expression, if they match and are equal it will have the aforementioned symmetry
