# Was a simple lesson, mainly remember the few things below
## Terms
- **Polynomial Function** of degree `n` whose equation can be written as something like a quadratic, you know this.
- **Leading Coefficient** is the coefficient of the largest variable in terms of degree
- **Constant** is the same as programming
- **Even and Odd Degree Functions** are functions who are named base off the highest power of the function
- **End Behaviour** refers to the direction in which the function travels, its expressed by stating the starting and ending quadrants *(Eg. Q3 => Q4)*
- **Power Function** is a polynomial of the form `f(x) = ax^n` where `n` is a whole number, `x` is a variable and `a` is a real number.

## Types of Polynomial Functions
- Constant
- Linear
- Quadratic
- Cubic
- Quartic
- Quintic

## Info About Polynomial Functions
- Odd degree functions are always real, in both domain and range
- Even Degree Functions will always have a X E R
	- However Y will be above or below a certain point, such that it fulfills the requirements
- Odd degree polynomials with positive leading coefficients go from **Q3 => Q1**
- Odd degree polynomials with negative leading coefficients go from **Q2 => Q4**
- Even degree polynomials with positive leading coefficients go from **Q2 => Q1**
- Even degree polynomials with negative leading coefficients go from **Q3 => Q4**
