# Another Simple Lesson
## Solving Inequalities
- Remember, when adding or subtracting everything remains the same, however when dividing or multiplying you must change the sign of relation.
- You can easily solve these by graphing the equation using your previous knowledge of polynomials
- Better to use interval notation, though you can still use set notation, I believe thats what its called
- You may need to use Factor Theorem too, if other methods of factoring cannot be used
- Some functions cannot be factored, this does not necessarily mean there are no real roots, the roots will just likely be fractions/decimals, for these roots use [desmos](https://desmos.com)

## Steps to Solving
1. Ensure inequality is set equal to 0
2. Determine the roots by factoring
3. Either test an x-value within each domain to determine whether the function is posistive or negative
**OR**
3. Determine the degree of the function, sign of the leading coefficient and the order of each factor to use trends
4. Create a sign diagram/number line to summarize the info.
5. Make a final statement in proper notation
