# Another relatively simple lesson, tomorrows is supposed to be easier
This is literally the same as dividing as normal, you don't need practice on it.

The only thing of note is to remember remainders, and how to correctly state a therefore statement since it apparently isn't plainly obvious.

There are 2 ways but apparently you only need one and the other is painfully simple.

```md
Dividend = (Divisor)(Quotient) + Remainder
```

The quotient is the final answer.

The dividend is the thing being divided, the divisor is the thing you're dividing with.

The remainder is the remainder.
