# Factor theorem, pretty simple too
## Terms
- **Synthetic Division** is a shorthand method for polynomial long division, which can be used when dividing by a linear factor
- You should know how to draw this

## Factoring Notes
- Sometimes you have to just factor it normally, factor out something out of the first 2 and last 2 terms and see if that works
- You can also use factor theorem, where you use what we learned in [[2.03 Remainder Theorem]] just find a factor that makes the remainder theorem 0.
- Factors will always be factors of the constant
- Note when you have a leading co-efficient that isn't 1, you have to apply the `ax - b` rule, where now your factor will be `b/a`.
- Take the following example:
```md
5x^3 + 3x^2 - 12x + 4
```
- Factors can be plus minus, 1, 2, 4, but it can also be, 1/5, 2/5, 4/5 (All are still plus minus)
- What a pain
