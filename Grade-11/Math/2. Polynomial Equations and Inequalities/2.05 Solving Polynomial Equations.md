# Solving Polynomial Equations
## Solving the thingys
- Luckily almost nothing's changed from other grades
- You just try and find which values of x allow you to get 0
- Or in simpler terms, set the function to be equal to 0 and find all possible values of x.
- In most cases you can just use algebra and good old factoring and grouping to solve, other times you will have to use factor theorem, find a factor, then find all other factors using synthetic division
- You might also have to sketch the graph, you will only need the `x intercepts` and the `y intercepts`  

## Complex Numbers (Not on the Test)
- Sometimes you need to use the quadratic formula to solve questions, this means sometimes you end up with a negative discriminant which of course makes the question impossible to answer
- You can then use imaginary numbers, which make the answer complex, i, represents the square root of -1
- This is of course impossible, but allows us to answer questions as i can be squared meaning you will have a value of -1, you don't really need to know this right now though
