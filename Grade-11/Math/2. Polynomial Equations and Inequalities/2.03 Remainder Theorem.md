# Short Lesson
- The remainder theorem is basically when function `P(x)` has `(x - b)` as a factor, the functions output should be the remainder when you divide x - b into the function
- For cases like `P(x)` and `ax - b` the remainder is `P(b/a)`
- This can be used to find the remainder quite quickly, in addition to factors of a function
