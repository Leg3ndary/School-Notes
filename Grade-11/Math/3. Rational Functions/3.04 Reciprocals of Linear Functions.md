# This is just review of rational functions
## Definition of a reciprocal function
When you add, subtract, or multiply 2 polynomial functions, the result is another polynomial function.

When you **divide** polynomial functions, the result is a **rational** function:

```
f(x) = P(x) / Q(x), Q(x) =/ 0
```

Since division by zero is undefined, rational functions have special properties known as asymptotes.

On graphs we denote this using dotted lines.

A **reciprocal** function is a specific type of rational function where it is the opposite of a given function. The product of the original function and its reciprocal will multiply to get a result of 1.
