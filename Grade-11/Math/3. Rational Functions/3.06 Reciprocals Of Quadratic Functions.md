# Another lesson on rational stuff
- The first part of this lesson describes the lesson before and is asking us to just recall the previous lessons
- You need to review and memorize this
- Theres nothing really to note about this lesson, we continue examining functions, this time reciprocals, only thing of note is we must determine vertexes for the mini parabolas
- You should also note that we redefined what an asymptote really is, points may cross it, but it's just the line that the infinities approach
