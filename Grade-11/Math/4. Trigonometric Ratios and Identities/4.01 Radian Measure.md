# Math gets more confusing woohoo

- The **degree** is a commonly used unit for the measure of angles in trig applications. One complete revolution around a circle is defined as 360 degrees
- Hence, 1 degree is just 1 360th of a full rotation
- However, in many other areas of science and advanced math, a more useful (different) unit of measure for angles is a unit called the **radian**
- A radian is defined by theta = arc / radius
- That's all there really is
- You can also convert between radians and degrees by using pi over 180 and 180 over pi respectively
