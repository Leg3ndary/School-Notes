# Intro to learning common sense
Limits are the basis of derivatives in calculus, and the process of finding the limits of functions is pretty important.

## Terms
- The **limit of a function** is the y-value (behaviour) that a **function** takes near a particular x-value
- You should know basic notation for limits, "The limit of the function `f(x)` as `x` approaches `a` is `l`"
- **Piecewise functions** are functions that are split into multiple parts, notation is sort of like JSON
	- You have the opening bracket but no end bracket
	- Each line represents a function/equation
	- The first part is the actual function
	- The second part after the comma is where the function actually takes effect
- **DNE** stands for does not exist, this is what you use instead of N/A

## Determining Limits
- It's not hard, literally just use common sense to figure out what it should be according to trends in the graph.
- This does mean that if it looks like it's approaching different values from both sides that it will not exist
- You can say limits are approaching from different sides, you should also know this notation. + is right, - is left
- Limits only exist when 3 conditions are met
	- Lim approaching a from the left exists
	- Lim approaching a from the right exists
	- Both of these limits are equal to each other
- You can say limits are equal to pos/neg infinity though you can also say it does not exist.

## Types of Limits
- There are 2 types of limits
	- Finite limits, when the limit is actually a finite real number
	- Infinite limits, when the limimt is an infinite number
