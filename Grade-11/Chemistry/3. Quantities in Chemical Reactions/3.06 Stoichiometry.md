# Hamburger Analogy

- **Stoichiometry** is calculations that involve chemical reations, they also involve mole ratios
- You can determine information about a problem through other info inside the acctual problem
- The rest of the lessons go on to show how you can use these ratios to solve for stuff, really just easier physics from here.
- Only thing of note is percentage yield, which has the formula

```md
		    Actual Yield
%Yield = ------------------- x 100%
		  Theorticial Yield
```

## Why do reactions produce less than 100% yield

1. Not all products are recovered
2. Equipment limitations
3. Reactant impurities
4. Side reactions
5. Reaction does not go to completion
6. Product is not dry
