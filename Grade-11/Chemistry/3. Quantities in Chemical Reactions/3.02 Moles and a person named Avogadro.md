# Odd naming but meh

- **Atomic Masses** on the periodic table don't actually represent it's weight
	- Rather it represents how many atoms it takes to get Avogadros number, which is 6.02 x 10^23
	- We don't use actual masses of atoms because it's just too confusing and too small
- You were given 2 formulas to remember, both of which are oddly named, but work
- **n = N / Na**
- **n = m / M**
- You should know both of these
- You also now review molar mass which helps with the second formula
- **Molar Mass** is also the average atomic weight, but varies between different compounds and molecules
- You can calculate it by adding up all the average atomic weights of everything
