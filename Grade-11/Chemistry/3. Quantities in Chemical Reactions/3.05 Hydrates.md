# The odd stuff

- **Hydrate** is an ionic compound that has a specific number of water molecules bound to each formula unit
- **Anhydrous** is an ionic compund that has no attached water molecules
- **Naming Hydrates**, you remember how to do these, name first part normally, name second part greek prefix method - hydrate
- **IMPORTANT** When given questions, you can heat or evaporate the water from hydrate compounds to get a sort of salt like substance, this will look different, and will weigh a different amount, you can use this to find out how much water was in the original substance
