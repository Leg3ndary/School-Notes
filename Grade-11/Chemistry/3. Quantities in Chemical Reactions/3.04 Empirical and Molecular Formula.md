# Simple Enough

- The **Empirical Formula** of a compound is the simplest simplified formula, this is also ionic compounds, since we always have to reduce the ratios
- **Molecular Formulas** are the full version, or the actual version, basically emprical but not reduced

## To Find Empirical

1. Convert the % to mass, just change the % to g
2. Then do mass to moles by using it's average atomic mass
3. Divide by the smallest number possible to get at least 1 element with a 1: ratio
4. Then just multiply until you have +- 0.05 error and round if needed
5. Write it out as you would always

## To Find Molecular

1. Find empirical formula
2. Divide the actual molar mass given to get a multiplication factor
3. Multiply
4. Finish
