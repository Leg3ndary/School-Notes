# Little experiment/Lab
**Purpose** To use a molecular model kit to determine the shpaes of various molecules
**Materials** moleculur model kit
**Procedure**
1. Draw the lewis strcuture for the molecule in the space provided in the table.
2. Construct a model of the molecule using the parts from the molecular model kit, make all of it's possible bonds.
3. Draw a diagram of the model in the space provided in the table, find the correct diagram shape
