# More Hard Stuff
## Binary Acids
- Have **two** elements
- **Recall:** acids are compounds containing a **hydrogen ion (H+)** and a non-metal

### Naming
- Name it hydro**nonmetal**ic acid
- For example, HCl(aq) is Hydrochloric Acid
- HBr(aq) Hydrobromic Acid

### Formula
- **crisscross** the valances/charges
- Hydrosulfuric Acid is H2S(aq)
- Hydroiodic Acid is HI(aq) because these balance out as 2 to 2\

## Bases
- Contain a **hydroxide ion OH-** bonded to a metal

### Naming
- Name this like **metal + hydoxide**
- For example
- Ca(OH)2 is calcium hydroxide
- NaOH is sodium hydroxide
- Fe(OH)3 is iron hydroxide

### Formula
- **crisscross** the valances/charges again
- Use **brackets** if there is more than one hydroxide
- Lithium hydroxide is LiOH
- Copper (II) hydroxide is Cu(OH)2

## Diatomic Gases (HOFBrINCl)
These are the gases that are always bonded to each other when in elemental form

You can memorize these with Dr Hofbrincl.
