# Metals!
## Multivalent Metals
- Some elements have more than one possible valence
- For example, Iron can be Iron II, or Iron III, each with 2+, and 3+ charges, respectively, you learned this already
- Could form 2 possible compounds that would both technically be called iron oxide

### Naming
1. IUPAC Method (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry)
- Compounds with **multivalent** metals only (You can check the back of your periodic table)
- Indicate which ion is involved in the compound by putting the **charge** (valence) in **brackets** after the name of the metal
- For example, if we have FeO and iron has a valence of 2+ we name **iron (II) oxide**
- In the case of Fe2O3 iron which has a valence of 3+ we call this **iron (III) oxide**
2. Ous - Ic Method (Older method)
- Compounds with **multivalent** metals only (check the back of your periodic table)
- Indicate the higher valence with the **"ic"** ending and the lower valence with the **"ous"** ending
- Historic names are often used, these should also be on the back of your periodic table
- In the case of FeO we would call this **Ferrous Oxide** because they both have a charge of 2
- In the case of Fe2O3, iron has a charge of 3 making it **Ferric Oxide** as its the higher valence

## Naming Covalent Compounds - Greek Prefix Method
- You can also use **prefixes** to say how many of each atom are present in the compound (based on the **subscript**)
- **One** is never used for the first element
- Prefixes go Mono, Di, Tri, Tetra, Penta, Hexa, Hepta, Octa, Nona, Deca
- This you know how to do.
