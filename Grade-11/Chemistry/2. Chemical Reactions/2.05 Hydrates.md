# Hydrates, very simple

- Hydrates have a specific number of water molecules in their chemical formulas
- As solids, these water molecules are part of the compounds structure.

## Rules for Naming Hydrates

1. First name the ionic compound using IUPAC naming rules
2. Then just use greek prefixes and name it hydrate

An example of this is CACl2 * 8H2O, this would be called Calcium Chloride OctaHydrate

You should remember this, it's actually quite simple, you will use mono for hydrates and one.
