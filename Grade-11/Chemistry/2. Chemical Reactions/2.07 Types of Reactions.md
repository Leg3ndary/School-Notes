# The 5 types of reactions

## 1. Synthesis
- This reaction forms **one** compound from **two** or more reactants.
- General Equation: A + B -> AB
- Combustion falls under this category

## 2. Decomposition
- Reaction in which **one substance** is broken down into **two or more smaller substances**
- General Reaction: AB -> A + B

## 1.5. Combustion
- Reaction of any compound with oxygen
- You have 2 main types
	- **Metal or Nonmetal Element with Diatomic Oxygen**
	- A + O2(g) = AO
	- You just combine this into an oxide!
	- Then you have hydrocarbon with diatomic oxygen, this can further have 2 different states
	- **Complete Combustion**
	- This is when CxHy + O2 creates Hydrogen Dioxide and Carbon Dioxide
	- **Incomplete Combustion**
	- This is when CxHy + O2 creates Hydrogen Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, and some carbon, this  will usually leave some sort of solid residue

## 3. Single Displacement
- Reaction in which one **substance** replaces **another** in a compound
- Remember **metals** can only replace **metals**, and **non metals** can only replace **non metals**, the same goes for **polyatomic ions**
- General Equation: A + BC -> B + AC
- You can use the activity series to determine whether reactions here will actually happen

## 4. Double Displacement
- This reaction is when the ions in **two compounds change places**
- Metals, non metals, and polyatomic ions can only replace each other respectively
- General Equation: AD + BC -> AC -> BD
- There are 2 types of double displacement reactions
	- Reactions that produce a solid precipitate
	- You can use the solubility table to tell you this
	- Reactions that have a hydroxide and a hydro acid and produce water are known as neutralization
	- This can also happen with acids and carbonates/bicarbonates
