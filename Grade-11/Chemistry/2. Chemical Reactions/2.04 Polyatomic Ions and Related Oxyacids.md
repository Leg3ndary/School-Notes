# More naming stuff, sighs
## Polyatomic Ions
- A group of atoms that stay together and have an overall ionic charge

## The standard Polyatomic Ions
- All Standard ions have an **"ate"** ending
| Formula   | Name      |
| --------- | --------- |
| [ClO3]-   | Chlorate  |
| [BrO3]-   | Bromate   |
| [IO3 ]-   | Iodate    |
| [NO3 ]-   | Nitrate   |
| [SO4  ]2- | Sulfate   |
| [CO3]2-   | Carbonate |

### If there is...
- One **more** oxygen than the standard number of oxygens in the original polyatomic ion
	- Name it like so: per-------ate
	- [ClO4]- is perchlorate
- One **less** oxygen than the standard
	- Name it like so: ------ite
	- [ClO2]- is chlorite
- Finally, when you have **two** less oxygen than the standard
	- Name it like so: hypo------ite
	- [ClO]- is hypochlorite

## Oxyacids
- Basically you add H+ to polyatomic ions

### The Standard Oxyacids
- All standards are named using the **"ic"** ending
| Formula | Name          |
| ------- | ------------- |
| HClO3   | Chloric Acid  |
| HBrO3   | Bromic Acid   |
| HIO3    | Iodic Acid    |
| HNO3    | Nitric Acid   |
| H2So4   | Sulfuric Acid |
| H2CO3   | Carbonic Acid | 

### If there is...
- One **more** oxygen than the standard number of oxygens in the original polyatomic ion
	- Name it like so: per-------ic acid
	- HClO4(aq) is perchloric acid 
- One **less** oxygen than the standard
	- Name it like so: ------ous acid
	- HClO2(aq) is chlorous acid
- Finally, when you have **two** less oxygen than the standard
	- Name it like so: hypo------ous acid
	- HClO(aq) is hypochlorous acid
