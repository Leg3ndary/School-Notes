# This gets pretty complicated smh
## Valences (Charges)
- **Valence** is the charge assigned to an atom in a molecule
- The sum of valences must be **0** for an ionic compound
- Some elements have **more** than one possible valence (multivalence)
	- For example, the valence of Pb in PbO is 2+ while PbO2 has a valence of 4+
- You will usually use a refernce sheet to see elements with multiple valences

## Binary Compounds
- Compounds with only **two** elements
- The first element only has one possible **valence**

### Naming
1. Name the first element normally
2. Change the ending of the second to **"ide"**
- NaCl - Sodium Chloride
- Na2O - Sodium Oxide
- CaH2 - Calcium Hydride

### Formulas
1. Write the symbols of each element
2. Determine the valences (charge) of each element
3. Criss-cross the valences and write them as subscripts
4. Simplify and reduce if needed
Subscripts of one are not written in the final formul a
