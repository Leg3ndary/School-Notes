# Just stuff you gotta memorize T-T

## Synthesis Reactions

1. Element + Element -> Compound
3. Nonmetallic oxide + Water -> Acid
4. Metallic Oxide + Water -> Base

## Decomposition Reactions

1. Binary compound -> element + element
2. Carbonate -> Carbon Dioxide + Metallic Oxide
- We saw this with H2 CO3 which immediately decomposes into H2O CO2

## Combustion Reactions

1. Element + Oxygen -> Oxide
2. Hydrogencarbon + Oxygen -> Carbon Dioxide + Water Vapour

## Single Displacement Reactions

1. Literally just use your nice activity series table
2. In the case of Metal + Water/Acid, you will produce diatomic hydrogen as well as a hydroxide.

## Double Displacement Reactions
