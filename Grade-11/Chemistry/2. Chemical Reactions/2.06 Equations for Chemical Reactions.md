# Equations for Chemical Reactions

There are 3 types of chemical Equations

1. Word Equation
Calcium Hydroxide Solution + Hydrochloric Acid -> Calcium Chloride Solution + Water
2. Skeleton Equation
Ca(OH)2(aq) + HCl(aq) -> CaCl2(aq) + 2H2O(l)
3. Balanced Chemical Equation
You literally just balance the equation

You can have a **catalyst** over the arrow which makes it go faster, woah.
