This has an associated lab linked [[Flame Tests Lab|here]].
- When elements are subjected to heat or electricity the **electrons** in the atoms become excited.
- The electrons absorb energy and jump from the **ground state** to the **excited state** through whats known as a **quantum jump**.
- What goes up m ust come down and therefore eventually the electron in the **excited state** will fall back to the **ground state** and release **energy** in the form of colored light.
- The **colour** of the light emitted depends on how big the jump is and thus the amount of **energy** released.
- Violet requires a big jump, higher energy, and has a smaller wavelength
- Red requires a smaller jump. lower energy and a larger wavelength
## Line Spectrum
- A series of coloured **lines** separated by bands of blackness
- When the coloured light is viewed through a **spectroscope** you can see that every element has a unique **line spectrum** which can be used to identify the **element** in question.
