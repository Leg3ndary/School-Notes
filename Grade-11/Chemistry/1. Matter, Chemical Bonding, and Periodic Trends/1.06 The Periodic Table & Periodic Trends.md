# Periodic Stuff
- **Periodic law:** Chemical and phsyics properties of elements repeat in a regular pattern when arranged by increasing atomic number
- **Periods:** Horizontal rows
- **Groups:** Vertical columns, will usually have the same number of valence electrons, which give similar properties
- **Valence Electrons** are electrons in the outermost shell of a electrons orbital levels
- When examining periodic trends always look at number of energy levels
- As you go down a group, the number of energy levels increase
- As we go across a period L to R, the number of protons increase

## Ionization Equations
- Atoms will lose or gain electrons (react) so that they're [[Isoelectronic]] with the nearest noble gas
- This makes the atom stable as its orbits are full

## The Four Periodic Trends
1. **Atomic Radius**
- Represents the size of the atom
- In general, going **down** a group, the atomic radius increases due too more energy levels.
- Going **across** a period, the atomic radius decreases due to more protons, but same energy levels
2. **Ionization Energy**
- The amount of energy required to remove an electron from an atom (or ion) from the outermost energy level
- More loosely held electrons are more easily removed and therefore a lower ionization energy
- The more valence electrons and levels the harder it is to remove electrons meaning therefore you have **higher** energy levels
- In general, going **down** a group increases the inoization energy due to more energy levels
- Going **across** a period, ionization energy increases because more protons but same energy levels
3. Electron Affinity
- How much more stable an atom is after gaining an electron
- Large negative numbers have high EA
- Negative sign means energy is released
4. Electronegativity
- Ability of an atom to attract electrons into a bond
