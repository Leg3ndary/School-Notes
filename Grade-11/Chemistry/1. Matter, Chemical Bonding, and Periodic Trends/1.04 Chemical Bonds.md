## Electronegativity
- A measure of an element's ability to **attract** electrons in a **chemical bond**.
- If the electronegativity of one of the two atoms in the bond is **greater** than the electronegativity of the other atom, the electrons will be more **strongly** attracted to the first atom.
- Electrons spend more time around atoms with **higher** electronegativity
- You can compare electronegativity values of the two elements involved in a chemical bond to determine the bond type
- Using electronegativity we can determine what sort of bond the 2 elements have.
```md
Ionic, Delta EN >= 1.7
Polar Covalent Delta EN = 0.5 < x < 1.6
Covalent, Delta EN <= 0.4
```
- You find electronegativity by subtracting the smaller number from the bigger number

Polar moecules have uneven distribiution of charge, which has a partially positive 8 thing + and partially negative 8 thing -.

## Writing Bonds
When given 2 elements, first determine bond type using the electronegativity values, then if covalent, write `None` on top, if ionic, find the charges and write them down, if polar covalent, write the 8 thingy with a - for the bigger electronegativity value

## Intermolecular forces - Keeping molecules together
- Opposite ends of partially charged molecules **attract** creating intermolecular **forces**
- The higher the Delta EN, the **higher** the melting/boiling points

## Ionic Compounds - Formation & Lewis Structure
- Ionic compounds **transfer** electrons to produce positive ions **and** negative **ions**
- The opposite charges **attract** each other, the attraction is what holds the ions together
- **Charged** ions **conduct electricity** when dissolved in water
- The attraction between ions is **strong** and therefore ionic comounds
	- have **high melting points**
	- are solids at room temperatures
- When drawing lewis dot diagrams for the answer thingy
	- Only draw valence shell, one should be empty, the other having a full shell (8 electrons) make sure to draw ions in alternating fashion, also have the correct charge (opposite of sign with number of electrons transferred)
