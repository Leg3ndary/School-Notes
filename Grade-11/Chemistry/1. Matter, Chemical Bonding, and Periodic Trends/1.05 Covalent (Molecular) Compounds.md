# Reviewing Bonds and Stuff
## Recall
- **Polar Covalent Bonds** have electrons that are shared unequally
- **Covalent** Bonds have electrons that are shared equally
- e.g. Hydrogen and Bromine, Hydrogen is positive and bromine is negative since it has the higher [[1.04 Chemical Bonds#Electronegativity]]

## But how do we tell if they'll share unequally
- We can tell by subtracting their electronegativity values
