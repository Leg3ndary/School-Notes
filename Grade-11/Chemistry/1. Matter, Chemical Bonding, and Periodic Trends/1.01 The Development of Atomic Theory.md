# Boring History
## Democritus
- First proposed indivisible particles called atoms
## Dalton (1803)
- Called the billiard ball model
- Atom was a solid sphere
- All atoms of the same element are identical
## Thomson (1897)
- Called the plum pudding model
- Discovered electrons
- Atom was a positively charged sphere
## Rutherford (1906)
- Discovered the nucleus
- Did the gold foil experiment
- Planet like electrons orbit a positively charged nucleus
## Chadwick (1932)
- Discovered neutrons
## Bohr (1913)
- Electrons only have a specific amount of energy organized in energy levels also known as shells
## Schrodinger
- Showed that electrons were in a region of space often represented with a cloud

## Terms
- **Isoelectronic**
	- Noble gases have 8 valence electrons and therefore a very stable shell
		- Helium is an exception as it is stable with 2 valence electrons
	- Some atoms acquire stable octetes by gaining or losing electrons
	- Once they acquire a stable octet, they are said to be isoelectronic with the noble gas that has the same total number of electrons
