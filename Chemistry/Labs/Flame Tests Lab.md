## Analysis
1. In this experiment, what do you call the burning of the cotton swab plus acid?
This is a control
2. According to your results, is the anion or the cation responsible for the flame colour, explain.
Previous questions asked you to compare, the basic gist of this lab is that the **cation** is responsible for the flame colour and not the anion.
