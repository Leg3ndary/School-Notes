- **Isotopes** are atoms of the same element that have different masses due to a different number of neutrons, they also weigh different amounts.
	- Same number of protons and electrons means **similar chemical properties**.
- A **Radioisotope** is an unstable isotope of an element, it will undergo radioactive decay into a more stable nuclei.
	- This does mean that it can change elements entirely.
- The existence of isotopes can explain why the atomic mass on the periodic table is an **average atomic mass**, it's a **weighted average**.

Calculating the mass average is literally just multiplying it by its percentage and adding it.
